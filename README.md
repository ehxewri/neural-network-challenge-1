# README: Neural Network Challenge - Student Loan Repayment Prediction

## Background
At our company, which specializes in student loan refinancing, predicting borrower repayment capabilities is vital for setting accurate interest rates. This project focuses on developing a neural network model capable of predicting the likelihood of student loan repayments based on borrower data.

## Project Files
- **Module 18 Challenge files**: [Download here](https://www.example.com/download)
- **student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb**: Starter file to be used in Google Colab

## Initial Setup
1. **Repository Setup**: Create a new GitHub repository named `neural-network-challenge-1`.
2. **Clone Repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine.
3. **Add Starter File**: Add the downloaded `student_loans_with_deep_learning.ipynb` to your repository.
4. **Push Changes**: Ensure all changes are pushed to your GitHub repository.
5. **Google Colab**: Upload the notebook to Google Colab for development.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Data Preparation
- **Data Reading**: Load the dataset from [student-loans.csv](https://static.bc-edx.com/ai/ail-v-1-0/m18/lms/datasets/student-loans.csv) into a Pandas DataFrame. Identify potential features and target variables.
- **Dataset Creation**: Separate the data into features (X) and target (y) datasets. Use the `credit_ranking` column as the target.
- **Data Splitting**: Divide the datasets into training and testing sets.
- **Data Scaling**: Utilize scikit-learnâ€™s StandardScaler to scale the feature data.

### Part 2: Model Development and Evaluation
- **Neural Network Design**: Construct a deep neural network using TensorFlow's Keras. Tailor the model architecture based on the number of input features.
- **Model Compilation and Training**: Compile the model with binary_crossentropy loss function, adam optimizer, and accuracy metric. Fit the model on training data.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess the model with testing data to determine its loss and accuracy.
- **Model Saving**: Save and export the model as `student_loans.keras`.

### Part 3: Predicting Loan Repayment
- **Model Loading**: Reload the saved model.
- **Make Predictions**: Apply the model to the testing data, generate predictions, convert them to binary values, and save the results in a DataFrame.
- **Classification Report**: Generate and analyze a classification report based on the predictions and the testing data.

### Part 4: Recommendation System Discussion
- **Data Requirements**: Discuss the types of data required for a student loan recommendation system and its relevance.
- **Filtering Method**: Define whether the system will use collaborative, content-based, or context-based filtering and justify the choice.
- **Real-world Challenges**: Identify and explain two real-world challenges in building a student loan recommendation system.

## Hints and Considerations
- Review data preprocessing methods from previous modules if needed.
- Ensure consistency in preprocessing for both training and testing datasets.

## Requirements
Ensure that your Jupyter Notebook includes detailed sections for each part of the project, demonstrating all steps from data preparation to predictions and discussions on the recommendation system.

**Push all changes and updates regularly to your GitHub repository to track version history and collaborate effectively.**
